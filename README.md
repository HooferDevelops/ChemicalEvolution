# Chemical Evolution
A Minecraft 1.18 Forge mod. This was made for the purpose of me learning Java a bit more, as well as the want to make a Minecraft mod.

## Previews
TODO

# Building
This should be fairly straightforward for any mod developers. Use latest JDK (https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17) with your preferred Java IDE (Created with IntelliJ).
